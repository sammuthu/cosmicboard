# Sammuthu.dev – AI-Augmented Developer Portfolio

This is the personal profile site of Sam Muthu — a 25+ year veteran software engineer and AI-augmented developer. This site showcases:

- 🚀 **Real-world projects** built with AI-assisted development workflows (Segment Loop Master, zScripts)
- 🧠 **Prompt engineering** examples used in Claude, Windsurf, and ChatGPT to build, debug, and design
- 💻 **Code snippets** in Java, Python, JavaScript, and Shell for practical microservice, scripting, and automation tasks
- 🎥 **Screen recordings** showing step-by-step progress from project idea to working implementation
- ⚙️ **Mac productivity setup** with `asdf`, `Alfred`, `Keyboard Maestro`, `zshrc`, and `powerlevel10k`

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Content**: MDX for mixed Markdown + JSX storytelling
- **Code Blocks**: Shiki or Prism.js for syntax highlighting
- **Hosting**: Vercel, custom domains (`sammuthu.dev`, `sammuthu.com`)

## 🧠 AI Assist Strategy

This project will be co-developed using:
- **Claude Code**: For file generation, refactoring, and doc writing
- **ChatGPT (Mimi)**: For planning, prompts, and mentoring
- **Windsurf**: IntelliJ-based AI pair programmer

## 📜 Goals

- 🎯 Land an AI-assisted engineering role
- 💼 Demonstrate mastery in RAG, MCP, prompt design, and dev workflows
- 🧭 Show thought process, not just results
