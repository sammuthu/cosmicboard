---

## Decision Log

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Why offline-first in Phase 5 instead of Phase 1?**
- Rationale: Offline sync is complex and increases development time significantly. Starting with cloud-first allows faster MVP and easier debugging. By Phase 5, user base justifies investment.

**2. Why AI in Phase 2 instead of later?**
- Rationale: AI is a major differentiator. Early implementation creates competitive advantage and generates user excitement. Modern AI APIs make this feasible without heavy ML infrastructure.

**3. Why analytics before collaboration?**
- Rationale: Single-user analytics are simpler to build and provide immediate value. Collaboration adds complexity; better to perfect individual experience first.

**4. Why AWS migration so late?**
- Rationale: Early stage can run on simpler infrastructure. AWS migration makes sense when scaling needs justify complexity and cost. Allows learning user patterns first.

**5. Why localization before AWS?**
- Rationale: Localization is pure frontend/content work that can run in parallel with infrastructure planning. Opening global markets early maximizes growth potential.
